                <h2>Deuteronomy 30:15-19</h2>
                <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>
                <p> 
                    <sup>15</sup>“See, I have set before you today life and good, death and evil.                     
                    <sup>16</sup>If you obey the commandments of the LORD your God that I command you today, by loving the LORD your God, by walking in his ways, and by keeping his commandments and his statutes and his rules, then you shall live and multiply, and the LORD your God will bless you in the land that you are entering to take possession of it.                     
                    <sup>17</sup>But if your heart turns away, and you will not hear, but are drawn away to worship other gods and serve them,                     
                    <sup>18</sup>I declare to you today, that you shall surely perish. You shall not live long in the land that you are going over the Jordan to enter and possess.                     
                    <sup>19</sup>I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse. Therefore choose life, that you and your offspring may live,
                </p>

                <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

                <p><b><sup>6</sup> I am shocked that you are turning away so soon from God, who called you to himself through the loving mercy of Christ. You are following a different way that pretends to be the Good News</b> <br> <br>
                    Paul began his letter with a brief, beautiful explanation of what the gospel message—the "good news"—about Jesus truly is. Jesus gave His life to pay for human sin before being returned to life by God the Father. Scholars call this "substitutionary atonement," meaning Jesus took our place and paid the full penalty for our sin. Without that, we would be trapped and doomed to death instead of being delivered from "this present evil age." <br> <br>
                    Paul is frustrated with his readers, if not angry. He is, in fact, "astonished" that they are so quickly turning away from the simple truth. More specifically, Paul writes that they are deserting or abandoning Christ Himself by believing a different idea, a different "gospel," than the one he showed them.</p> <br>
